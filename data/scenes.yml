dense forest:
  dense forest:
    - You're deep in a dense wood. The sunlight barely reaches the forest floor.
    - You're standing in a small clearing next to a small stream.
  desert:
    - You emerge from the trees suddenly and look down a gentle slope into a vast desert.
desert:
  desert:
    - You're at the base of a steep sand dune leaning into a strong wind.
    - You gaze upon an endless expanse of fine sand bleached bone white.
  forest:
    - You're standing at the edge of the desert peering into a dense forest.
